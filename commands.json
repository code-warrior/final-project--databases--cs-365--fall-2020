//Choose to not have personalInfo and academicInfo as two collections to be similar to original assignment 2 because the commands for retrieving all the info from students with a GPA greater than 3.5 would require at least 5 more queries to get the info of the students.
//I could get all of the academic info of students with a gpa greater than 3.5 but it would take an additional query for each student to display their personal info.
//Having all of the info in one collection requires only one command to yield all the info of said students.
